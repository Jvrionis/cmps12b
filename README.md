# cmps12b Introduction to Data Structures and Data Structures Laboratory
Teaches students to implement common data structures and the 
algorithms associated with each data structure, through progressively
difficult exercises. Topics include big "O" notation; pointers, 
recursion (induction), and dynamic allocation; linked lists and list 
processing; stacks, queues, binary trees and binary search trees; 
simple sorting techniques and simple search techniques. Students 
will gain a working knowledge of the elements of the Java and C 
programming languages. Prior experience with Unix is assumed. <br />
### Lab
An additional competence is gained with a number of important 
software development tools, languages, and techniques. Included 
are advanced Unix features and utilities such as **grep**, **find**, 
**diff**, **the shell**, and **pipes**; C programs utilizing **I/O**, **arrays**, 
**pointers**, and **structures**; a scripting language to perform simple
text and file manipulation; and the make utility.<br />
