File(s):        README  MakeFile  Search.java  Search.class  file1

Purpose:        Implement the Binary Search and Merge Sort algorithms 
                discussed in class. Adapt these methods to operate on String 
                arrays rather than int arrays by changing the comparison of 
                the array elements given s1 and s2. This program will take
                command line arguments giving a file to be searched and target
		        word(s) to search for.

Compiling:      use 'make' to compile Search.java. use 'make clean' to
                remove .class files

Running:        java Search <file in> target1 [target2 target3 ...]
                EX (after make): java Search file1 however initial value key



 
Summary:  	This program sorts file1 included in my ~/cs12b/pa2/ 
		    This program will print the <word searched> if it is there and 
            will output
		    the line number it was originally found on. If a word is not 
            there it will 
		    simply print <searched word> not found.
output:
