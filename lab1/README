		Makefile1 Makefile2 Makefile3 README 
 About: 	This was a lab about creating a 'make' file(s) running java code with the created makefiles.
            	After you run make -f Makefile1, make -f Makefile2, or make -f Makefile3 
		each make -f <command> must be followed by a 'clean'. 
		EX: make -f Makefile1. make -f Makefile1 clean.
