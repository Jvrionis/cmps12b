File(s):        README MakeFile FileReverse.c FileReverse.o FileReverse

Purpose:        To write a program in C that takes an input file with the alphabet
                and writes the file in reverse to a file called out. 

Compiling:      Do the following (for Ubuntu users):
                make
                .\FileReverse <input file> <output file> 

Summary:       This is the C version of the java program FileReverse that did for lab2.
               After making an executible jar file, it will take two command line 
               arguments naming the input and output files in and out, reversing the 
               contents of 'in' into a new file called 'out'.
