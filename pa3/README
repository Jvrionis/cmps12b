File(s):        README, Makefile, DictionaryClient.java, Dictionary.java,
				DuplicateKeyException.java, KeyNotFoundException.java,
				DictionaryInterface.java, DictionaryTest.java

Note:			DictionaryTest.java is a test client used Dictionary ADT 
				under construction (cleaned up).	

Purpose:        Store a key and a value in a linked list

Compiling:  	make to compile all files or type javac DictionaryTest.java or 
				type javac DictionaryClient.java. Both of these test Dictionary.java
				for functionality.

output 1:       % make
				% java DictionaryClient
				1 a
				2 b
				3 c
				4 d
				5 e
				6 f
				7 g

				key=1 value=a
				key=3 value=c
				key=7 value=g
				key=8 not found

				2 b
				4 d
				5 e
				6 f

				false
				4
				true
	
output 2:  		( if running after output 1: )
                % make clean
                % javac DictionaryTest.java
				% java DictionaryTest

Summary:       Implementation of a Dictionary ADT base on a linked list data structure using seven 
			   ADT operations and a collection of states. This linked list data structure contains
			   two exception classes to be thrown: DuplicateKeyException.java and KeyNotFoundException.java which are both subclasses of RuntimeEception. The test file
			   DictionaryTest.java was used to check each operation. I went over Pa3 assignment after
			   I deleted and cleaned up my code and saw that comments of old code should be saved. I 
			   made sure my testing is complete in order to make up for this.
