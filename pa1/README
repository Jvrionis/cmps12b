Purpose: 	Implementing recursive Algorithms in Java with five 
            recursive methods

Output:     The output of the program will be the following six lines:

		    -1 2 6 12  9 2 -5 -2 8 5 7 
		
		    minIndex = 6
		
		    maxIndex = 3
		
		    7 5 8 -2 -5 2 9 12 6 2 -1
		    7 5 8 -2 -5 2 9 12 6 2 -1
		    7 5 8 -2 -5 2 9 12 6 2 -1

Summary:	This program uses recursive methods to reverse the order of three 
            Arrays
		    
            It also finds the number with the highest value returning its index.
		    It also finds the number with the lowest value return its index.
