                in lab2:
                FileReverse.java in out Makefile README

Summary:        In CommandLineArguments ~!@#$%^&*()_+ any of these 
                as arguments will break the program. I have not 
                tested the other programs for this problem but 
                Beware.
                To run the eample code is there is such a need
                the normal javac <program> then 
                java <program> <file in> <file out> because there 
                is only one make file and that is for the lab 2.
