## Purpose:     The goal of this assignment is to gain experience with an 				
# 				advanced feature in Java called Generics (similar to the
# 				notion of Templates in C++. Java Generics allow you to
# 				abstract over types: For example if we consider IntegerList 
#				ADT DoubleList, or BooleanList or any other kind of List
#				ADT.Conveniently, to build a single List-of-anything ADT that 
# 				could be reused with any data type.
#
## Compiling:	#to see my ListTest.java: 
#				javac ListTest.javac
#				#on ubuntu
#				java ListTest
				
#				# Normal Compilation:
#				make 
# 				# on ubuntu 
#				java ListClient
                
## output:      A: one two three 
#				B: ten twenty thirty 
#				C: one two three  ten twenty thirty  
#				A.equals(A) is true
#				A.equals(B) is false
#				A.equals(C) is false
#				A.size() is 3
#				B.size() is 3
#				C.size() is 2
#				A.size() is 2
#				B.size() is 2
#				B.get(1) is ten
#				C: two three  ten thirty  
#
#				Caught Exception: 
#				ListIndexOutOfBoundsException: get(): invalid index: 200
#				Continuing without interuption
#
#				A.get(2) is three
#				C.get(1) is two three 

## Summary:    This program should produce identical output to the "model-out"
#			   file provided online. ListTest.java must test all ADT operations also
#			   using @SuppressWarnings( "<warning>") which overrides the errors shown
#			   using -Xlint. The list implements a generic List interface defined in 
#			   the ListInterface.java (found online), testing this interface using 
#			   ListTest.java.
